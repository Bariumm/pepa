# Pepa DMS

## What is Pepa?

Pepa is a document management system primarily designed for archiving
and retrieving your digital documents. It's implemented in Clojure and
ClojureScript. Pepa can be used from within your browser and - this
goes without saying - you can view all your documents there.

### How does Pepa work?

Any document management system (any archive whatsoever really) would
be pretty useless if it would only store documents. To be more than
just a black hole for documents, a DMS should aid you in organizing
the documents. You should be able to not only store your documents,
but to search for them and - even more importantly - to find them.

Pepa uses a tagging system inspired by
[Notmuch](http://notmuchmail.org/) to achieve this. A tag is a text
label that the user adds to a document. This could be anything from
`invoice` to `university` or `work` or `doctor` or `contracts` or
`papers` or ... Of course you can add more than one tag to a document.
A document tagged with `invoice` can additionally be tagged with
`unpaid` or `paid` for example.

Those tags can be used to find a document. You want to find every
document that's an unpaid invoice? Easy, let Pepa search for documents
which are tagged with `invoice` and `unpaid` - once you have paid
those invoice, you can remove the `unpaid` tag and add the `paid` tag
instead.

Of course, Pepa allows not only searching by tag. Every document in
Pepa is available for full-text search. You can combine this search
with the tag search to increase your chances of finding just the
right document.


### Current features

- Supported formats
  - PDF
- Import channels
  - SMTP / email (attachments are extracted)
  - HTTP (API and upload via web interface)
- Manual tagging
- Full-text search
- OCR (via Tesseract and/or CuneiForm)
- Interactive document dissection

### Planned features

- User management and groups/organisations
- Rule-based (automatic) tagging
- Self-learning tagging
- Additional document types
  - JPG, PNG, TIFF
  - Plain text
  - HTML
  - Email

### Features not planned

Since we want to keep our focus, the following features are not
planned to become a part of Pepa:

* Support for proprietary and/or very complex file formats. notably
  Microsoft Word, Excel, and Powerpoint. Neither are we planning to
  implement support for documents from LibreOffice or OpenOffice.
  Those formats are not well suited for archiving and good support
  would be too much effort.

Since Pepa is open source, you are of course free to implement those
features yourself.

## Project status

Pepa is currently in an early development stage which means that it's
not ready for production use, yet, as there will be frequent breaking
changes still. You are very welcome to give it a try, though, and we
are happy to receive feedback either via GitHub issues or
[by email via pepa@bevuta.com](mailto:pepa@bevuta.com). Note that
since there is no official release, yet, you will have to build Pepa
from sources to run it (see build instructions below).

## Build instructions

To build and run Pepa on your system, you'll need Java (at least
version 7), [Leinigen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/),
[PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/),
[Poppler](http://poppler.freedesktop.org/),
[PDFtk](http://www.pdfhacks.com/pdftk). For OCR you'll need
[CuneiForm](https://launchpad.net/cuneiform-linux) and/or
[Tesseract-OCR](https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/).

Obtain the source via `git` like this:

    git clone git@github.com:bevuta/pepa.git

The following sections will run you through the process of setting up
a working environment to run and hack on Pepa for various target
platforms. It is assumed that the current working directory is the
project root, so:

    cd pepa

And you are good to go.

### NixOS

Pepa comes with a NixOS container which makes setting up the
dependencies a breeze. First, create and start the `pepa-dev`
container like this:

    sudo nix/dev-container

This script is idempotent so you can run it whenever you want to start
the Pepa environment. Now we need to create a `config.clj` so Pepa
knows where to find the PostgreSQL database server. Since it is
running inside the container, we can programmatically generate the
file from `resources/config.sample.clj` like this:

    sed "s,<db-host>,$(nixos-container show-ip pepa-dev)," resources/config.sample.clj > config.clj

Next, compile the ClojureScript:

    nix/lein cljsbuild once

If you intend to hack on the frontend code, you might want to run
`nix/lein cljsbuild auto` instead. Finally, start the REPL:

    nix/lein repl

And you are set. Start the server by calling the `(go)` function in
the `user` namespace. Alternatively, if you don't need a REPL, you can
just use `nix/lein run` to start the server. The `nix/lein` script
will start Leinignen in a `nix-shell` environment which contains all
necessary (non-Java) dependencies.

Note that you can use `nix/psql` to convenietly open a `psql` shell
for the PostgreSQL instance running inside the container at any time.


### Arch Linux

Install [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen/) on your
system (see instructions on their website). All other dependencies are
available via `pacman`.

    sudo pacman -S jdk8-openjdk pdftk postgresql poppler cuneiform tesseract tesseract-data-eng tesseract-data-deu

Next,
[configure PostgreSQL according to the instructions in the Arch Linux wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PostgreSQL)
and add a line to the `pg_hba.conf` for the `pepa` user, e.g.:

    sudo sh -c 'echo host pepa pepa 127.0.0.1/32 trust >> /var/lib/postgres/data/pg_hba.conf'

Now (re-)start the server:

    sudo systemctl restart postgresql

Create a role and database for Pepa:

    sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER pepa"
    sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE pepa OWNER pepa"

Using that new role, import the database schema:

    psql -h localhost -U pepa pepa < resources/schema.sql

Create a config file (`pepa` is the default role and database name so
we only need to set the hostname):

    sed "s,<db-host>,localhost," resources/config.sample.clj > config.clj

Next, compile the ClojureScript:

    lein cljsbuild once

If you intend to hack on the frontend code, you might want to run
`lein cljsbuild auto` instead. Finally, start the REPL:

    lein repl

Start the server by calling the `(go)` function in the `user`
namespace. Alternatively, if you don't need a REPL, you can just use
`lein run` to start the server.
